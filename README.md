# Lab 8 - Starter

Note: it says that vbnqwe did the last commit, but vbnqwe is the account that I use for personal nonschool projects. If you search up the account, you will find that name from the profile is vbogdev2. For some reason, even if I sign out on github desktop and sign into my school account, it still lists all commits as done by vbnqwe. If necessary, I can prove that vbnqwe is my account as the email that I use for that github account is the email that I use for all non-school stuff.

Questions:
1) 1 - A github action will ensure that your code will always be automatically be tested making it the most efficient and will always do tests on updates, unlike 2 and 3.
2) No, e2e testing is for testing ui.
3) You can, as long as the sending of a message is encapsulated in a method/function. This can be done to test for how edge cases will run.
4) No, as the capping of a message seems to be done in the UI, meaning that you would need E2E testing to test this.
